 Linux Live Ubuntu
 
   This is modified version of Linux Live scripts.
   Modifications were done to allow easy building LiveCD of
   Ubuntu 9.04 (Jaunty) i386. It uses original Ubuntu kernel
   therefore some scrips and files had to be changed.
   Lzma compression disabled.

 Linux Live scripts

   These scripts are used to create Slax Live CD. It may be used to make
   a bootable CD from your real Linux distribution as well. Just install
   your distro somewhere, unpack these scripts somewhere in $DISTRO/tmp,
   login as root, make changes to .config file and finally run ./build

   You'll be asked for the name of your LiveCD during the build process.
